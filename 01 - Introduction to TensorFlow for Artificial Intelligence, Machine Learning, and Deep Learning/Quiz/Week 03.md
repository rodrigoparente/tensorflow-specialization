# Questions and Answers

## 1. Question 1
What does the pooling technique do to the images?

- [ ] Combines them.
- [ ] Isolates features in them.
- [ ] Makes them sharper.
- [x] Reduces information in them while maintaining important spatial features.

**Correct**  
Good job! Pooling reduces information without removing all of the features.

## 2. Question 2
After max pooling a 26x26 image with a 2x2 filter, the output will be 56x56.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

**Correct**  
Yes! The output would actually be 13x13.

## 3. Question 3
How do convolutions improve image recognition?

- [ ] They make the image smaller.
- [ ] They make processing of images faster.
- [x] They capture spatial features in images.
- [ ] They make the image clearer.

**Correct**  
Spot on! Additionally, a properly designed convolution layer can even make training faster.

## 4. Question 4
True or False. If you pass a 28x28 image through a 3x3 filter, the output will be 26x26.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

**Correct**  
Nailed it!

## 5. Question 5
How does using convolutions in neural networks impact training? Select the best answer.

- [x] Its impact will depend on several factors.
- [ ] It makes it faster.
- [ ] It does not affect training.
- [ ] It makes it slower.

**Correct**  
Correct! Using convolutions might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed convolutional neural network may even be less efficient than a plain DNN!
