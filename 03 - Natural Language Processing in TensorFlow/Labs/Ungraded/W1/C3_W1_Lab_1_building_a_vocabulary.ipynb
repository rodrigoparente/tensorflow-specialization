    "# Ungraded Lab: Building a Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "In most natural language processing (NLP) tasks, the initial step in preparing your data is to extract a vocabulary of words from your corpus (i.e. input texts). You will need to define how to represent the texts into numeric features which can be used to train a neural network. Tensorflow and Keras makes it easy to generate these using its APIs. You will see how to do that in the next cells."

    "2. Splitting each example into substrings. By default, it will split into words. See its `split` argument for other options.\n",
